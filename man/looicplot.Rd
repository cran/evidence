\title{A dot plot is produced for several related models showing for
  each model its LOOIC-value with its credible interval.}
\description{The LOOIC-value (like the non-Bayesian AIC-value) is a
  useful measure of model performance for model prediction.}
\usage{
looicplot(looiclist, modnames, perc=90)
}
\arguments{
  \item{looiclist}{
    a list of rstanarm model objects }
  \item{modnames}{
    a character-valued vector of model names for each of the models }
  \item{perc}{
    the percentage credibility for the credible intervals (defaults to
    90\%) }
}
\value{
  None provided, but a printed list of looic-values, their standard
  errors, and credible intervals, and a dot plot with the same
  information are produced. }
